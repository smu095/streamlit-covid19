# Corona-virus Streamlit App

The aim of this project has been to familiarise myself with [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html).

[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) is an open-source app-framework for data science and machine learning. [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python, based on [Vega and Vega-Lite](http://vega.github.io/).

## Setup

Install the required packages in a virtual environment, e.g.:

```bash
$ source /path/to/venv/bin/activate
(venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the streamlit app by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/streamlit-covid19
$ streamlit run app.py
```
